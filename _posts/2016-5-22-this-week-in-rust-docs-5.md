# Latest news

The [Normalization for long error codes explanations RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1567) entered its final comment period!

[@pnkfelix](https://github.com/pnkfelix) proposed a [wonderful idea](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33675#issuecomment-219609913). I think we'll try to put it in place! :p

# Current opened issues

For now, here are the two big issues opened for Rust documentation:

 * [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
 * [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)

They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!

There are currently around 50 other documentation issues opened. Look for [A-docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-docs) tagged issues on github!
