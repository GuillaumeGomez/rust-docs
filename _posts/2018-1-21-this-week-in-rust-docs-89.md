# Latest news

The hoedown -> pulldown migration moved forward by a step this last week: now the default renderer is pulldown.

# Current opened issues

For now, here are the three big issues for Rust documentation:

* [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
* [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)
* [Document all features in the Rust reference](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference/issues/9)

They all need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!

There are currently around 70 other documentation issues opened. Look for [T-doc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-doc) tagged issues on GitHub!
