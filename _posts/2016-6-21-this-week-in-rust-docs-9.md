# Current opened issues

For now, here are the two big issues opened for Rust documentation:

 * [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
 * [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)

They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!

There are currently around 50 other documentation issues opened. Look for [A-docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-docs) tagged issues on github!

# Call for participation

There's now a call for participation to [display all methods of a type, even those from implicit traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33772). This is a great way to help users find everything that a type can do. Any help on it would be very appreciated!
