# Latest news

Things are moving on: we talked about hosting crates' documentation directly on an official doc website (the hostname hasn't been decided yet). It has already been discussed a few times in the past but nothing came out. For now, we're mostly trying to sort through all of the complexity. A lot of details must be taken in account and it is still at a very early stage of discussion but it started!

The [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32756) on the new rustc output is finally here (or almost)!

[@jonathandturner](https://github.com/jonathandturner) and [@peschkaj](https://github.com/peschkaj) are working on a style guide in order to help developers to write better library documentations.

Besides this, [@peschkaj](https://github.com/peschkaj) investigated the current doc status of the 20 biggest crates (based on number of downloads on [crates.io](https://crates.io)). Take a look at the report [The State of Rust Docs](https://facility9.com/2016/04/the-state-of-rust-docs-2016/).

# Current opened issues

For now, here are the issues opened for Rust documentation:

 * [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
 * [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)

They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!

# Recent doc contributions
