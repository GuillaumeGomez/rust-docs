# Latest news

We are currently talking about creating a rust docs day in order to help crates to improve/add documentation. Details remain to be done but it should be scheduled soon. Expect us!

Our "This Week in Rust Docs" seems to [inspire the Haskell community](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4hmjnp/this_week_in_haskell_docs/) as well. :)

# Current opened issues

For now, here are the two big issues opened for Rust documentation:

 * [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
 * [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)

They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!

There are currently around 50 other documentation issues opened. Look for [A-docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-docs) tagged issues on github!
